Apollo-Starter-Theme
====================

A Starter Theme for Drupal

This is a basic bare bones theme that I use for starting a custom Drupal theme. 
It strips out unecessesary code Drupal uses and serves as a clean starting point.

My plan is to continue to include industry standard principles. Right now, it uses some SMAC as well as SASS.

Currently there is no responsive framework included == soon to come
